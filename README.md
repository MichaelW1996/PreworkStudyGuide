# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description


- My motivation for this has been the desire to practice my skills in HTML,CSS, JS and git.
- I made this project to keep notes in, i may use this format in future to store notes, currently i use notion as its database features are useful
- it is a simple way to display notes that also shows practicle knowledge of the code, it can be changed to implement new knowledge to add features
- In the process i have learned skills for dividing up a larger project, using issues to request and log feature progress & using branches to implement these in a manner that avoids endagering the use of the page in the meantime

## Features

This study guide contains some basic panels holding tips in programming languages used for the project, currently it is somewhat feature poor, given time id like to develop it further to include visual changes based on screen size, mouseover & perhaps other factors, id also like to include some kind of carousel of cards with tips and images.

Submit a feature request as an issue on the github repo:  https://github.com/MichaelW1996/PreworkStudyGuide/issues
